* **NB!** For compiling this visualisation module on your own, it is recommended to use powerbi-visuals-tools version 4.3.3 (sic!, not the latest) and to follow [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/visuals/environment-setup). After following the setup, open Windows Powershell and run either `pbiviz package` to create a distribution into the code/dist folder or `pbiviz start` to run it locally and troubleshoot developer visuals while using PowerBI in the browser.
